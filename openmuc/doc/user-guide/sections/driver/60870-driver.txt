=== IEC 60870-5-104

IEC 60870-5-104 is an international communication standard for telecontrol.
The IEC 60870-5-104 driver uses the library from the j60870 project. +
The driver is able to send general interrogation commands for sampling. For writing
almost all commands are possible.

All options are separated by a semicolon.

*Device Address*

ca=<common_address> : Common address
p=<port> : Port of the server / controlled station
h=<host_address> : Host address of the server / controlled station

*Settings*

mft=<message_fragment_timeout> : Message fragment timeout, SO_Timeout (default: 5.000 ms)

cfl=<cot_field_length> : Cause Of Transmission (CoT) field length. (default: 2)
cafl=<common_address_field_length> : Common Address (CA) field length. (default: 2)
ifl=<ioa_field_length> : Information Object Address (IOA) field length. (default: 3)

cont=<connection_timeout>: Connection timeout t0. (default: 30.000 ms)
mtnar=<max_time_no_ack_received> Time-out (t1) of send or test APDUs (default: 15.000 ms)
mtnas=<max_time_no_ack_sent> : Time-out for acknowledges in case of no data messages t2 < t1 (default: 10.000 ms)
mit=<max_idle_time> :  Time-out for sending test frames in case of a long idle state, t3. (default: 20.000 ms)

mupr=<max_unconfirmed_ipdus_received> : Sets the number of unacknowledged I format APDUs received before the connection will automatically send an S format APDU to confirm them. This parameter is called w by the standard. Default is 8, minimum is 1, maximum is 32767. (default: 8)
mnoi=<max_num_of_outstanding_ipdus> : Sets the number of maximum difference send sequence number to send acknowledge variable before Connection.send will block. This parameter is called k by the standard. Default is 12, minimum is 1, maximum is 32767. (default: 12)

at=<allowed_types> : List of IDs (integer) of allowed ASduTypes. e.g. 1,10,36 for M_SP_NA_1(1), M_ME_TA_1(10) and  M_ME_TF_1(36) (default: all allowed )

*Channel Address*

Mandatory options are _Common Address_, _Type ID_ and _Information Object Address_.

It is possible to get a single value of a Sequence Information Element, for this
you can define _Index_ of the needed element. The first element is 0, the second 1, ...

For reading values which are divided in multiple elements it can be defined how many
elements should be read as one. e.g. _i=0;m=4_ says it reads from the first element
up to the fourth element, of a sequence. This is only allowed for _Binary State Information_.

With the option _Data Type_ it is possible to get a single quality flag.
